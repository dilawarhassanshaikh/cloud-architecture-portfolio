This architecture demonstrates a **citizen-only CIAM implementation** using
**Microsoft Entra External ID** for U.S. state public sector organizations.

The solution enables secure, scalable, and user-friendly access to
customer-facing government portals such as **DMV, Healthcare, and Benefits**
applications.

## Key Capabilities
