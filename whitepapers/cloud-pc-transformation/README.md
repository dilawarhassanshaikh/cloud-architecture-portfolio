# Cloud PC Transformation with Windows 365

## Overview
This whitepaper documents a **Windows 365 Cloud PC transformation** implemented for
a **Boston-based biotech organization** to support **temporary and contract-based workforces**.

The solution replaced traditional physical laptop provisioning with **secure Cloud PCs**,
resulting in **significant IT cost reduction (tens of thousands of dollars annually)** while
maintaining strong security and compliance controls.

## Business Challenge
The organization faced recurring challenges with:
- High cost of purchasing, imaging, and shipping laptops for short-term contractors
- Delays in onboarding and offboarding temporary staff
- Security risks associated with unmanaged or personally owned devices
- Operational overhead for IT support and device lifecycle management
  
## Architecture Overview

The architecture leverages **Windows 365 Cloud PC** as a centralized, secure desktop platform
delivered over the cloud, eliminating the need for physical endpoints.

## Key Technical Components
- **Windows 365 Cloud PC** for contractor desktops
- **Microsoft Entra ID** for identity and access control
- **Conditional Access** enforcing Zero Trust policies
- **Microsoft Intune** for device compliance and lifecycle management
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** for threat protection
  
## Cost Optimization Strategy
The cost savings were achieved through:
- Eliminating capital expenditure on physical laptops
- Reducing shipping, return, and refresh costs
- Rapid Cloud PC provisioning and deprovisioning aligned with contract duration
- Pay-as-you-go licensing instead of long-term hardware commitments
  
## Security & Compliance
- Identity-first Zero Trust access using Entra ID
- Conditional Access policies restricting access by user risk and device state
- No corporate data stored on local or personal devices
- Centralized monitoring and threat detection via Defender
  
## Business Impact
- **Tens of thousands of dollars in annual IT cost savings**
- Faster contractor onboarding (hours instead of days)
- Improved security posture with reduced attack surface
- Simplified IT operations and reduced support tickets
